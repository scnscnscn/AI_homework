This repository contains the code and notes created by the maintainer during the **first semester of their junior year** at **Zhejiang University of Technology**, while studying the course *Principles and Applications of Artificial Intelligence*. The content is optimized based on the sample code provided in the course.  

It is important to note that the **original course code used Baidu's PaddlePaddle framework**, whereas this repository adopts **PyTorch** instead.  

If you encounter any issues or have questions while using the code, please feel free to contact me via the **Issues** feature.
